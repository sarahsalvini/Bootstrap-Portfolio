<h1>Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio</h1>
Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application.

<h2>Directions</h2>
First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to recreate your portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:


Create the following pages: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.


<b>Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:</b>

<ul>
<li>A navbar


<li>A responsive layout


<li>Responsive images




<li>The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.
</ul>


<b>Hints</b>


Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).


On an xs screen, content should take up the entire screen. On sm and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.



<b>Minimum Requirements</b>

<ul>
<li>Functional, deployed application


<li>GitHub repository with README describing the project
</ul>


<b>Bonus</b>

Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation).
